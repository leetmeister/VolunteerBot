# Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) Model 
The VolunteerBot uses a language model powered by LUIS model for understanding user intent from natural language. The model is exported as a .json file of its training and classification data, and can be imported to create your own instance to power your customized chatbot.

To import the model:
1. Go to http://www.luis.ai and follow the instructions to create your account.
2. On the [My Applications](https://www.luis.ai/applicationlist) page of your account, click +New App and select Import Existing Application from the drop down menu.
3. Provide the path to the VolunteerOutreach.json file, and a name for your instance, then click Import.

To get started on using and publishing your newly created LUIS app, refer to the [LUIS Tutorial](https://www.luis.ai/Help).
